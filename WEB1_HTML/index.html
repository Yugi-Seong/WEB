  <p style="margin-top:45px;">The World Wide Web (WWW,W3), developed on December 16, 1989, and released and disseminated on December 20, 1990, is a freeze-woven space, such as a web thatallows information to be shared with people using computers connected to the Internet. Hypertext pages writtenin HTML based on the HTTP protocol are configuredto be read by a specific program called a web browser. WWW,W3, or simply the Web. Since 1994, when the Internet began to become available to the public,it has been the most prevalent Internet system to treat the Internet synonymous with virtually all. If you ask the public what it is to do the Internet, the majority of them will say that they are surfing the web with their web browser turned on.
Since the announcement, we've continued to add html's own capabilities, make CSS support for better design, create dynamic web pages instead of static web pages with JavaScript, and enable full-scale programming. In addition, with the addition of numerous JavaScript-based libraries with jQuery and various server-side frameworks such as PHP, ASP, JSP, CGI, Node.js, Django, ruby on Rails, and so on, it has enjoyed its status as another software platform, absorbing the capabilities of almost every other Internet system in 2015.
Currently, the latest standards are HTML5,CSS 3, and ECMAScript 7. The Acidtest can verify compliance with web browser-specificstandards.</p>
