  <p style="margin-top:45px;">In the past,it was common to write HTML with design elements. In other words, when we put all kinds of layout and design information into HTML, we turned it into a document for design, not a structured document, which is the main purpose of HTML. It was difficult for even experts to know what this document was like if you only look at the HTML source code because the tags that needed to be tabled were used to organize the layout.

[2]Accordingly, W3Cannounced CSS with the aim of "Create structured HTML by completely separating design elements from HTML!" Accordingly, we recommend that you do not use all design-related elements in HTML, such as: Since the CSS announcement, new tags such as divs, spans, sections, etc. have been introduced to help structure HTML statements, and style tags such as strike and font have been converted to non-rights tags and removed from HTML5at all. The table introduces thead and tbody tables to help structure tables, recommending that they be used only for the purpose of representing table-like data.</p>
